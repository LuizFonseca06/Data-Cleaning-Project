# &#9678; Data Cleaning Project - Outlook Contacts

The task consisted of cleaning from top to bottom a client's Outlook contact list. It was full on duplicated data, wrongly inputted information etc..

The initial number of duplicates was: 12155
At the end of the endeavor, that number was reduced to ZERO! And most importantly: without any loss of information!

EDIT: This was my first data project. I'm aware that sometimes it gets a little repetitive and that I didn't use the most appropriate or sophisticated libraries (FuzzyWuzzy would've come in hand), but that's because I did not know about then at the time or just wasn't experienced enough with this stuff. It is all done in good old pandas and numpy! Nonetheless, I'm still kind of proud of it since it was such a challenging task for a beginner.
